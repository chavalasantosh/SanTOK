## 1. BASIC ARITHMETIC

### 1.1 What is Arithmetic?
**Arithmetic** is the basic math we use every day.

**Think of it like this:**
- You have 5 apples
- Your friend gives you 3 more apples
- Now you have 8 apples total

**This is addition: 5 + 3 = 8**

### 1.2 The Four Basic Operations

#### **Addition (+)** - Adding things together
- **Example:** 20 + 20 = 40
- **How to think:** "I have 20, and I get 20 more, so I have 40 total"

#### **Subtraction (-)** - Taking things away
- **Example:** 40 - 20 = 20
- **How to think:** "I have 40, and I give away 20, so I have 20 left"

#### **Multiplication (Ã—)** - Adding the same number many times
- **Example:** 5 Ã— 4 = 20
- **How to think:** "I have 5, and I add it 4 times: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20"

#### **Division (Ã·)** - Splitting things into equal parts
- **Example:** 20 Ã· 4 = 5
- **How to think:** "I have 20, and I split it into 4 equal parts, so each part is 5"
