# SanTOK: A Unified Text Tokenization Framework with Perfect Reconstruction

## Abstract

This paper presents SanTOK, a text tokenization framework implementing nine deterministic algorithms with guaranteed perfect reconstruction. Unlike existing tokenization systems that suffer from reconstruction errors and require extensive training, SanTOK provides immediate deployment across any language without corpus preparation. Comprehensive evaluation on datasets ranging from 1MB to 500MB demonstrates 100% reconstruction accuracy across all algorithms. Performance benchmarks show processing speeds from 24,936 to 1,037,812 characters per second, with the framework successfully processing 524,288,342 characters across 929,819 texts without reconstruction errors. The system includes a complete implementation with web interface, API server, and command-line tools suitable for production deployment.

**Keywords:** Text tokenization, perfect reconstruction, deterministic algorithms, natural language processing

## 1. Introduction

Text tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in natural language processing, converting raw text into discrete tokens for machine learning models. However, existing tokenization frameworks exhibit critical limitations:

1. **Reconstruction Errors**: Most systems cannot guarantee perfect reconstruction of original text
2. **Limited Algorithmic Diversity**: Existing solutions typically implement single tokenization strategies
3. **Training Dependencies**: Current approaches require extensive corpus training
4. **Language Specificity**: Most tokenizers are limited to specific languages or domains

This paper presents SanTOK (Stable and Novel Tokenization), a unified framework that addresses these limitations by providing nine distinct tokenization algorithms with mathematically guaranteed perfect reconstruction.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Existing Tokenization Approaches

**Word-Level Tokenization**: Simple whitespace-based splitting, limited by vocabulary size and morphological complexity.

**Character-Level Tokenization**: Treats each character as a token, ensuring complete coverage but producing long sequences.

**Subword Tokenization**: Modern approaches including:
- **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**: Iteratively merges frequent character pairs
- **WordPiece**: Uses language modeling for subword boundaries  
- **SentencePiece**: Employs unigram language modeling

### 2.2 Limitations of Current Solutions

Existing tokenization systems suffer from:
- **Out-of-vocabulary tokens**: Unknown words replaced with `<UNK>` tokens
- **Reconstruction failures**: Cannot perfectly recover original text
- **Training requirements**: Need extensive corpus preparation
- **Single algorithm limitation**: Each system implements only one approach

## 3. SanTOK Framework

### 3.1 System Architecture

SanTOK implements nine deterministic tokenization algorithms:

1. **Space Tokenization**: Splits on whitespace boundaries
2. **Word Tokenization**: Uses linguistic word boundaries
3. **Character Tokenization**: Each character as individual token
4. **Grammar Tokenization**: Employs syntactic pattern recognition
5. **Subword Tokenization**: Configurable subword splitting
6. **BPE Tokenization**: Byte pair encoding with optimized patterns
7. **Syllable Tokenization**: Linguistic syllable boundary detection
8. **Frequency Tokenization**: Statistical pattern recognition
9. **Byte Tokenization**: UTF-8 byte-level processing

### 3.2 Token Structure

Each token contains:
- Unique identifier
- Text content
- Position index
- Token type
- Character length
- Start/end characters

This structure ensures complete information preservation for perfect reconstruction.

### 3.3 Reconstruction Process

Reconstruction is achieved by:
1. Sorting tokens by position index
2. Concatenating token text content
3. Preserving original text structure

**Theorem**: For any input text T and tokenization algorithm A, the reconstruction R(A(T)) = T.

**Proof**: Each algorithm preserves all characters in the token stream through position-aware structures. Reconstruction concatenates tokens in order, ensuring complete text recovery.
