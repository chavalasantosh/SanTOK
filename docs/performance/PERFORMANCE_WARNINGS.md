## ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Considerations

### Algorithm Performance Rankings

Based on comprehensive testing, here are the performance characteristics of each tokenization algorithm:

#### üöÄ **High Performance (600K+ chars/sec)**
- **Space Tokenization**: 927K-1.26M chars/sec
- **Word Tokenization**: 770K-1.10M chars/sec  
- **Grammar Tokenization**: 865K-1.16M chars/sec
- **Syllable Tokenization**: 615K chars/sec (consistent)
- **Byte Tokenization**: 552K-604K chars/sec

#### ‚ö° **Medium Performance (400K-600K chars/sec)**
- **Subword Tokenization**: 493K-667K chars/sec
- **Character Tokenization**: 388K-451K chars/sec

#### üêå **Lower Performance (200K-400K chars/sec)**
- **BPE Tokenization**: 308K-316K chars/sec
- **Frequency Tokenization**: 285K-309K chars/sec

## üìä Performance Guidelines

### For Production Use

**Recommended for high-throughput applications:**
- Space, Word, Grammar tokenization
- Use for real-time processing
- Best for large-scale text processing

**Use with caution for high-throughput:**
- BPE and Frequency tokenization
- Consider for batch processing only
- May need performance optimization

### Memory Usage

**Small Text (<10KB):**
- All algorithms perform well
- No memory concerns
- Use any tokenization method

**Medium Text (10KB-100KB):**
- All algorithms supported
- Standard memory usage
- Monitor performance for BPE/Frequency

**Large Text (>100KB):**
- Automatic chunked processing enabled
- Memory usage optimized
- All algorithms supported but with reduced speed

## üîß Optimization Recommendations

### For BPE Tokenization
- Use for batch processing
- Consider preprocessing for very large datasets
- Monitor memory usage

### For Frequency Tokenization  
- Use for batch processing
- Consider alternative algorithms for real-time use
- Good for pattern analysis applications

### For Large Datasets
- Chunked processing automatically enabled
- Monitor processing time
- Consider parallel processing for very large files

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

1. **Choose the right algorithm** for your use case
2. **Use Space/Word/Grammar** for high-speed applications
3. **Use BPE/Frequency** for batch processing
4. **Monitor memory usage** for large datasets
5. **Consider chunked processing** for files >100KB

## üö® Warning Signs

**Stop processing if:**
- Memory usage exceeds available RAM
- Processing time >10 seconds for 100KB text
- System becomes unresponsive

**Consider alternatives if:**
- BPE/Frequency too slow for your needs
- Memory constraints with large datasets
- Real-time processing requirements not met

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch
- **Characters per second**: Should be >200K for acceptable performance
- **Memory usage**: Should not exceed available RAM
- **Processing time**: Should be <1 second for 10KB text
- **Reconstruction accuracy**: Must be 100% for all algorithms

### Benchmarking
- Test with your specific text types
- Measure performance on your target hardware
- Consider your processing requirements
- Monitor memory usage patterns

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Start with Space/Word tokenization** for general use
2. **Use Grammar tokenization** for linguistic applications
3. **Use Character tokenization** for exact character-level processing
4. **Use Subword tokenization** for vocabulary optimization
5. **Use BPE/Frequency** only when specific patterns are needed
6. **Use Byte tokenization** for binary data or Unicode handling

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Slow Performance
- Check if using BPE/Frequency algorithms
- Consider switching to Space/Word/Grammar
- Verify text size and memory usage
- Check for system resource constraints

### Memory Issues
- Ensure chunked processing is enabled
- Reduce text size if possible
- Monitor system memory usage
- Consider processing in smaller batches

### Reconstruction Errors
- Verify tokenization algorithm compatibility
- Check for data corruption
- Ensure proper token structure
- Test with known good data
