# SanTOK: A Text Tokenization Framework with Perfect Reconstruction

## Abstract

This paper presents SanTOK, a text tokenization framework that achieves 100% perfect reconstruction across 9 tokenization algorithms. The framework supports space, word, character, grammar, subword, BPE, syllable, frequency, and byte tokenization strategies. Performance testing shows processing speeds ranging from 136K to 1.42M characters per second. The system includes a web interface, API server, and command-line tools.

**Keywords:** Text tokenization, perfect reconstruction, reversible algorithms

## 1. Introduction

Text tokenization converts raw text into discrete tokens for processing. Most existing systems do not guarantee perfect reconstruction. SanTOK addresses this by providing 100% accurate text reconstruction across all supported algorithms.

## 2. Implementation

### 2.1 Supported Algorithms

SanTOK implements 9 tokenization strategies:

1. **Space Tokenization**: Splits on whitespace
2. **Word Tokenization**: Uses linguistic boundaries  
3. **Character Tokenization**: Each character as token
4. **Grammar Tokenization**: Grammatical patterns
5. **Subword Tokenization**: Meaningful sub-units
6. **BPE Tokenization**: Byte pair encoding
7. **Syllable Tokenization**: Syllable boundaries
8. **Frequency Tokenization**: Common patterns
9. **Byte Tokenization**: UTF-8 byte level

### 2.2 Token Structure

Each token contains:
- Unique ID
- Text content
- Position index
- Token type
- Length

### 2.3 Reconstruction

Reconstruction sorts tokens by position and concatenates text.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Accuracy Testing

Tested with 10 different text samples including Unicode and special characters:

| Algorithm | Accuracy |
|-----------|----------|
| Space | 100% |
| Word | 100% |
| Character | 100% |
| Grammar | 100% |
| Subword | 100% |
| BPE | 100% |
| Syllable | 100% |
| Frequency | 100% |
| Byte | 100% |

### 3.2 Performance Testing

Performance measured across different text sizes:

| Algorithm | Small (750 chars) | Medium (9K chars) | Large (114K chars) | Very Large (300K chars) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Space | 857K | 433K | 1.10M | 785K |
| Word | 743K | 522K | 1.37M | 886K |
| Grammar | 590K | 489K | 1.42M | 749K |
| Syllable | 308K | 416K | 692K | 472K |
| Byte | 279K | 542K | 525K | 436K |
| Subword | 318K | 310K | 369K | 500K |
| Character | 184K | 286K | 387K | 359K |
| BPE | 176K | 157K | 246K | 257K |
| Frequency | 136K | 293K | 339K | 186K |

*All speeds in characters per second*

### 3.3 Memory Usage

- Small datasets: <1MB memory
- Large datasets: Chunked processing prevents overflow
- Successfully processes 300KB+ text

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Web Interface

- React-based frontend
- Real-time tokenization
- Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, TEXT, XML)

### 4.2 API Server

- FastAPI backend
- RESTful endpoints
- CORS support

### 4.3 Command Line Tools

- Python CLI interface
- Batch processing
- Multiple tokenizer options

## 5. Applications

- Text compression with perfect reconstruction
- Secure communication requiring exact recovery
- Data archival with lossless storage
- NLP preprocessing with reversibility

## 6. Features

### 6.1 Multi-language Support
- Automatic language detection (Latin, CJK, Arabic, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Thai, Devanagari)
- Language-specific word tokenization rules
- Support for mixed-language text

### 6.2 Parallel Processing
- Multi-threaded processing for large texts (>50KB)
- Multi-process processing option
- Automatic parallelization based on text size
- Performance improvements up to 2x speedup

## 7. Limitations

- Performance varies by algorithm (BPE and Frequency are slower)
- Memory usage scales with text size
- Parallel processing overhead for small texts
- Multi-process processing may be slower due to overhead

## 8. Future Work

- Algorithm optimization for slower methods
- Advanced compression algorithms
- GPU acceleration for parallel processing
- More language-specific tokenization rules

## 9. Conclusion

SanTOK provides a complete tokenization solution with guaranteed perfect reconstruction across all 9 supported algorithms. The framework includes production-ready tools and achieves competitive performance while maintaining data integrity.
