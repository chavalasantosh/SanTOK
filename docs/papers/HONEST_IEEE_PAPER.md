# SanTOK: A Text Tokenization Framework with Perfect Reconstruction

## Abstract

This paper presents SanTOK, a text tokenization framework that achieves 100% perfect reconstruction across 9 tokenization algorithms. The framework supports space, word, character, grammar, subword, BPE, syllable, frequency, and byte tokenization strategies. Performance testing shows processing speeds ranging from 136K to 1.42M characters per second. The system includes a web interface, API server, and command-line tools.

**Keywords:** Text tokenization, perfect reconstruction, reversible algorithms, performance optimization

## 1. Introduction

Text tokenization converts raw text into discrete tokens for processing. Most existing systems do not guarantee perfect reconstruction. SanTOK addresses this by providing 100% accurate text reconstruction across all supported algorithms.

## 2. Implementation

### 2.1 Supported Algorithms

SanTOK implements 9 tokenization strategies:

1. **Space Tokenization**: Splits on whitespace
2. **Word Tokenization**: Uses linguistic boundaries  
3. **Character Tokenization**: Each character as token
4. **Grammar Tokenization**: Grammatical patterns
5. **Subword Tokenization**: Meaningful sub-units
6. **BPE Tokenization**: Byte pair encoding
7. **Syllable Tokenization**: Syllable boundaries
8. **Frequency Tokenization**: Common patterns
9. **Byte Tokenization**: UTF-8 byte level

### 2.2 Reconstruction

Each token contains:
- Unique ID
- Text content
- Position index
- Token type
- Length

Reconstruction sorts tokens by position and concatenates text.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Accuracy Testing

Tested with 10 different text samples including Unicode and special characters:

| Algorithm | Accuracy |
|-----------|----------|
| Space | 100% |
| Word | 100% |
| Character | 100% |
| Grammar | 100% |
| Subword | 100% |
| BPE | 100% |
| Syllable | 100% |
| Frequency | 100% |
| Byte | 100% |

### 3.2 Performance Testing

Performance measured across different text sizes:

| Algorithm | Small (750 chars) | Medium (9K chars) | Large (114K chars) | Very Large (300K chars) |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Space | 857K | 433K | 1.10M | 785K |
| Word | 743K | 522K | 1.37M | 886K |
| Grammar | 590K | 489K | 1.42M | 749K |
| Syllable | 308K | 416K | 692K | 472K |
| Byte | 279K | 542K | 525K | 436K |
| Subword | 318K | 310K | 369K | 500K |
| Character | 184K | 286K | 387K | 359K |
| BPE | 176K | 157K | 246K | 257K |
| Frequency | 136K | 293K | 339K | 186K |

*All speeds in characters per second*

### 3.3 Memory Usage

- Small datasets: <1MB memory
- Large datasets: Chunked processing prevents overflow
- Successfully processes 300KB+ text

## 4. Implementation Details

### 4.1 Web Interface

- NLP preprocessing with reversibility
- Research applications

## 6. Limitations

- Performance varies by algorithm (BPE and Frequency are slower)
- Memory usage scales with text size
- Currently optimized for English text
- Single-threaded processing

## 7. Future Work

- Algorithm optimization for slower methods
- Multi-language support
